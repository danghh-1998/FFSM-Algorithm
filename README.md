# FFSM Algorithm
The program implements FFSM algorithm from paper. Basically, it finds frequent patterns that occur in given graph database and send it out to standard output.

Input: It accepts an integer as a minsup and a database of graphs from standard input.

Output: It prints out frequent graphs to standard output.

### REquirements
- Java 8 or higher
- Neo4j
